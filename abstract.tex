The importance of fairness constraints in the clustering domain of unsupervised learning has been increasing in recent years. Since there are already various papers on the algorithms used for this purpose, this paper aims to provide an overview of the possibilities to add fairness constraints in different clustering algorithms. After a clarification of important terms, definitions and concepts, the known algorithms for $k$-center, $k$-means and spectral clustering are explained and the possible fairness constraints are shown and compared.
